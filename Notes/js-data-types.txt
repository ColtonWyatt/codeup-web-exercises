I can keep note here
Primitive Types

Exercise 1
----------
Identify the data type of the following values:

1. 99.9 = number
2. "false" = string (because its in quotes"
3. false = bullion
4. '0' = string (in single quotes)
5. 0 = number
6. true = boolean
7. 'true' = string

What data type would best represent:

A term or phrase typed into a search box? String
If a user is logged in? Boolean
A discount amount to apply to a user's shopping cart? Number
Whether a coupon code is valid or not? Boolean
An email address typed into a registration form? String
The price of a product? Number


Exercise 2 (Operators)
----------------------
operator : symbols
expression: statements that result in a single value
expressions are made up of operators, variables, and literals
concatenation: adding, combining, joining two literals together
modulus helps us with odds and evens
boolean expressions- expressions that result in a boolean
= assigns
== compares / boolean
=== compares strictly
=== will check value and type

----------------------

Determine the result of the expression:

1. '1' + 2 = '12' (string and add the 2)
2. typeof '1' + 2 = 'string2' (typeof gives what it is, then we add the 2
3. 6 % 4 = 2 (4 can go into 6 once with a remainder of 2)
4.'3 + 4 is ' + 3 + 4 = '3 + 4 is 34'
5. 0 < 0 = false
6.'false' == false = false
7. true == 'true' = false
8. 5 >= -5 = true
9. !false || false = true
10. true || '42' = true
11. !true && !false = false
12. 6 % 5 = 1
13. 5 < 4 && 1 === 1 = False
14. typeof 'codeup' === 'string' = true
15'codeup' === 'codeup' && 'codeup' === 'Codeup' = false
16. 4 >= 0 && 1 !== '1' = true
17. 6 % 3 === 0 = true
18. 5 % 2 !== 0 = true

-----------------------------------

Variables

declare a variable
assign a value
Const can not be re-assigned

----------------------------------

Working with data types, operators, and variables

-----------------------------------

1.  var a = 1; = 1
    var b = a++; = 2 (after it is called on again)
    var c = ++a; = 2
    // what is the value of a, b, and c? These answers are assuming
    it is in sequential code

2.var d = "hello";
  var e = false;

  d++; = NaN
  e++; = 0

3. Var  perplexed
    perplexed  + 2 = NaN

4. var price = 2.7;
    price.toFixed(2) = 2.70

-----------------------------------------------

Word Problems:

1. You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days),
Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it),
and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it).
If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

var pricePerDay = 3
var theLittleMermaid = 3
var broBear = 5
var herculese = 1
var totalCost
totalCost = (theLittleMermaid + broBear + herculese) * pricePerDay

2. Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and
Facebook, they pay you a different rae per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380,
and Facebook $350. How muh will you receive in payment for this week? You worked
10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google, and 4 hours for Amazon.

var googleRate = 400
var amazonRate = 380
var facebookRate = 350
var googleHours = 6
var amazonHours = 4
var facebookHours = 10

var totalMoneyEarned = (googleRate * googleHours) +
(amazonRate * amazonHours) + (facebookRate * facebookHours)

3. A student can be enrolled in a class only if the class is not full and the
class schedule does not conflict with their current schedule.

var noConflicts = true
var notFull = true
var canBeEnrolled = noConflicts && notFull

4. A product offer can only be applied if a person buys more than 2 items, and
the offer has not expired. Premium members do not need to buy a specific amount of
products.

var boughtMoreThan2 = true
var boughtTwoOrLess = False
var notExpired = true
var expired = false
var premiumMember = true
not premiumMember = false
var productOffer = notExpired && boughtMoreThan2 || premiumMember && notExpired

5. Use the following code to follow the instructions below:

var username = 'codeup'
var password = 'notastrongpassword'

var username = 'codeup';

var password = 'notastrongpassword';

var atleastFiveChar = true

var lessThanFive = false

var noUsername = true

var usernameFound = false

var userNotMoreThan20 = true

var userExceeds20 = false

var noWhitespace = true

var whitespace = false;

var validUsername = userNotMoreThan20 && noWhitespace;

var validPassword = atleastFiveChar && noUsername && noWhitespace

validPassword

var validCredentials = validPassword && validUsername

validCredentials
